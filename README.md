# ProjectA
Simple Autonomous Car
This project is under the supervision of Sprints with collaboration of IHUB to build an autonomus car using the ATmega32.
The project consists of five stages:
1st stage is just getting the car to move in one direction
2nd stage is adding the sensing feature to the car. It is now able to tell if there is any obstacle infront of it
3rd stage is adding the atonomus feature to the car. The car take a decision and act upon it accordingly if there is an obstacle in front of it
4th stage is adding the communication feature to the car without the autonomus decisions. It means the car is driven manually
5th stage is integrating all the previous features together. The car now is autonomus and can communicate with other cars
